# Vibe Coding Log — Marketing Campaign Dashboard

Development log for the MBA assignment. Every feature built, bug fixed, refactoring done, and architecture decision made is recorded here.

---

## [#1] Project Setup
**Type:** architecture
**Summary:** Defined the project scope, tech stack, and development workflow. Created foundational documentation files (README, CLAUDE.md, LOGS.md) before scaffolding begins.

**Brainstorming:** Decided to document the full process from the very start — before any code exists — so the MBA submission captures the entire development journey including planning decisions. CLAUDE.md serves as the living spec and progress tracker; LOGS.md captures reasoning and iterations for each step.

**Prompt:** Create CLAUDE.md and LOGS.md based on the README. Set up ongoing workflow rules for every type of interaction (feature, fix, refactor).

**What was built:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — project context, tech stack table, full feature checklist with checkboxes, architecture section (to be filled post-scaffold), workflow rules
- `LOGS.md` — this file; vibe coding log for MBA submission

**Key decisions & why:**
- Separate CLAUDE.md from LOGS.md — CLAUDE.md is the living spec (state of the project at any moment), LOGS.md is the historical record (how we got there)
- Feature checklist in CLAUDE.md — makes it easy to track progress at a glance and check off items as they're built
- Log format distinguishes Full Entry vs Short Entry — keeps the log readable without burying small fixes in the same detail as major features

**Challenges / iterations:**
- None at this stage — documentation-only step

**What could be improved:**
- Architecture section in CLAUDE.md is a placeholder; will be fleshed out once the Vue project is scaffolded and folder structure is decided

**Lessons learned:**
- Starting documentation before code forces clarity on scope and decisions. Having a checklist of all features upfront means nothing gets forgotten once we're deep in implementation.

## [#2] Vue App Scaffold
**Type:** architecture
**Summary:** Scaffolded the Vue 3 + TypeScript app inside the `app/` folder with Tailwind CSS v3 (indigo custom theme), SCSS, and a single `AppShell` layout component. Set up dependency locking and a monorepo `.gitignore`.

**Brainstorming:** Key decisions discussed before building: folder name (`app/`), package manager (`npm` with `package-lock.json` for locked installs), TypeScript vs plain JS (TypeScript chosen), and Tailwind theme color (indigo). Tailwind v3 was chosen over v4 for stability — v4 is still in flux. SCSS is added via the `sass` package; Vite supports it natively with no extra plugin config.

**Prompt:** Scaffold Vue app in `app/` folder — basic app with one component, locked packages, `.gitignore` for monorepo, SCSS, Tailwind with indigo custom theme, README install/run instructions.

**What was built:**
- `app/` — Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript project, scaffolded via `npm create vite@latest`
- `app/package-lock.json` — dependency lock file (all installs are reproducible)
- `app/tailwind.config.js` — Tailwind v3 with `primary` color scale mapped to indigo (`#eef2ff` → `#1e1b4b`) and system font stack as sans
- `app/postcss.config.js` — PostCSS with Tailwind + Autoprefixer
- `app/src/style.scss` — replaces `style.css`; includes `@tailwind` directives and base body/app resets using `theme()` helper
- `app/src/components/AppShell.vue` — layout wrapper with indigo header and main content slot; uses BEM + scoped SCSS + Tailwind `theme()` for values
- `app/src/App.vue` — root component, mounts `AppShell`
- `app/index.html` — updated title to "Marketing Campaign Dashboard"
- `.gitignore` — at repo root, excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env*`, editor and OS files
- `README.md` — added "Getting Started" section with `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`

**Key decisions & why:**
- `app/` subfolder instead of root scaffold — keeps the repo root clean for docs, LICENSE, and future additions (e.g. a backend service)
- `npm` + `package-lock.json` — simple, built-in locking; no extra tooling like `pnpm` needed at this stage
- TypeScript — type safety will pay off when building composables for CSV parsing and chart data transformations
- Indigo theme mapped to `primary` — abstracted color name means we can swap the palette later without touching component classes
- `theme()` in SCSS — keeps component styles tied to the Tailwind config as the single source of truth for tokens
- Boilerplate removed — `HelloWorld.vue`, demo assets, and default `style.css` all deleted to start from a clean slate

**Challenges / iterations:**
- `style.css` → `style.scss` rename required updating the import in `main.ts`
- Tailwind init placed config files correctly inside `app/` since the shell was already in that directory

**What could be improved:**
- `AppShell` header is static text for now; will need a nav slot as routing is added

**Lessons learned:**
- Vite's native SCSS support (no plugin needed, just install `sass`) keeps the config surface area small. Tailwind's `theme()` helper inside SCSS files is a clean way to share design tokens without duplicating values.
